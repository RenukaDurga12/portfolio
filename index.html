    <p>
      Welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm Renuka, a passionate
      second-year graduate student at GITAM University in Bangalore. I am
      dedicated to honing my skills and knowledge in the dynamic realm of web
      development and programming.
    </p>
    <h3>Education and Background:</h3>
    <p>
      I embarked on my academic journey at GITAM University, where I am pursuing
      a degree that aligns perfectly with my love for technology and coding. As
      a dedicated student, I consistently strive for excellence and eagerly
      engage in opportunities to expand my horizons.
    </p>
    <h3>Technical Proficiencies:</h3>
    <p>
      My toolbox consists of HTML, CSS, and Python, which empower me to create
      engaging and user-friendly websites. With HTML and CSS, I craft the visual
      and structural elements that breathe life into web pages, ensuring a
      seamless and visually appealing user experience. My proficiency in Python
      allows me to add interactive and functional features, turning static
      websites into dynamic platforms.
    </p>
    <h3>Passion and Ambition:</h3>
    <p>
      My passion for web development extends beyond the classroom. I am
      continuously exploring new trends, tools, and techniques in the field,
      driven by an insatiable curiosity to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech
      landscape. I believe that every line of code has the potential to
      transform ideas into reality, and I'm excited to be a part of this
      transformative process.
